Estimating the strength of any password is an important aspect of Information Security. 
In this challenge, your task is to calculate the strength of a given password in terms of 
weights assigned to the characters.

A password consists of English lowercase letters only.
Each English lowercase letter has assigned an integer weight in the range from 
0 to 25 inclusive in such a way that the weight of letter  is given explicitly and 
weights of other letters follow in cyclic order. 

func getStrength(password: String, weight_a: Int) -> Int {
    var weight = weight_a
    var letterToWeight = [String:Int]()
    
    for letter in "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" {
        if weight > 25 {
            weight = 0
        }
        letterToWeight["\(letter)"] = weight
        weight += 1
    }
    print(letterToWeight)
    
    var strength = 0
    for letter in password.lowercased() {
        if let value = letterToWeight["\(letter)"] {
            strength += value
        }
    }
    return strength

}
