A coin was tossed numerous times. 
You need to find the longest streak of tosses resulting "Heads" and the longest streak of tosses resulting in "Tails".

func getMaxStreaks(toss: [String]) -> [Int] {
    var maxHeads = 0
    var maxTails = 0
    var consecutive: [String] = []
    
    for coin in toss {
        if let coinBefore = consecutive.last {
            if coin == coinBefore {
                consecutive.append(coin)
                if coin == "Heads", maxHeads < consecutive.count {
                    maxHeads = consecutive.count
                }
                if coin == "Tails", maxTails < consecutive.count {
                    maxTails = consecutive.count
                }
            } else {
                consecutive = []
                
                consecutive.append(coin)
            if coin == "Heads", maxHeads < consecutive.count {
                maxHeads = consecutive.count
            }
            if coin == "Tails", maxTails < consecutive.count {
                maxTails = consecutive.count
            }
                
            }
        } else {
            consecutive.append(coin)
            if coin == "Heads", maxHeads < consecutive.count {
                maxHeads = consecutive.count
            }
            if coin == "Tails", maxTails < consecutive.count {
                maxTails = consecutive.count
            }
        }
    }
    return [maxHeads, maxTails]
}
