A deck of cards contains 52 cards, where each card has a suit and a number written on it. 
There are 4 suits, namely A, B, C and D, and numbers on cards are from range 1 to 13.

Before the game starts, one of the suits is decided to be called the winning suit.
Then, the play begins and two players play exactly  rounds as follows:

first, each player draws a single card from the deck

if one of the players drew a card of the winning suit and the other did not,
then the player who drew a card of the winning suit wins the round

otherwise, the numbers written on the cards decide:
if one player drew a card with a greater number on it than the other player,
the player with the greater number wins, otherwise, if both players drew cards with the same numbers, 
the round ends in a draw

after the round is ended, the players return the cards they drew into the deck

Given the cards the players drew in each round, determine the result of each round of the game.

func getRoundResult(winning_suit: Character, suit1: Character, number1: Int, suit2: Character, number2: Int) -> String {
    if suit1 == winning_suit, suit2 != winning_suit {
        return "Player 1 wins"
    }
    if suit2 == winning_suit, suit1 != winning_suit {
        return "Player 2 wins"
    }
    
    if number1 == number2 {
        return "Draw"
    }
    if number1 > number2 {
        return "Player 1 wins"
    } else {
        return "Player 2 wins"
    }
    

}
